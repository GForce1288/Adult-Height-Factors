Topic: Physical Height (by country) versus Diet and Geographic Location
<br>
Description: What factors contribute to an adult's physical height? The first answer might just be genetics, but other factors must have helped create an environment that led to the average height of a country being where it is. Without any background research, I imagine a diet consisting of meat (protein) and dairy (calcium) lead to taller people. It also does not hurt to come from a more wealthy country where food, healthcare, and the overall quality of life is much better. I've also heard off-the-wall theories that people in the north are generally taller than people in the south because of the pull of the gravitational force. Not sure about that.

What I seek to study in this data science project is the correlation between diet types (one-part using FourSquare data to determine types of restaurants in the major cities), a country's wealth, and the country's overall average height (male and female). I Will also look at other contributing factors as I poll other people and come up with them (perhaps looking at the percentage of younger populations versus old, average sleep time, etc.)

I imagine people in the north (or further from the equator) might be taller as they are forced to rely on animals for their food source (climate), whereas people in the south might be shorter because they eat more vegetables/fruits and are less dependent on animals as food sources. We will see what the data says.
